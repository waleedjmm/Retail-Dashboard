# BI Dashboard in Plotly Dash with Highly Customized Features:


<p> A good BI dashboard enables you to monitor and measure business performance and track important KPIs.  In this project I have developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash, a Python web framework, where beautiful interactive charts are displayed according to the design provided by the client. Also, I have integrated several machine learning models into it for predicting the sales, profit and also the storage capacity of the retailer warehouse. This dashboard has empowered my client to take important decisions about his organization, and helped him in saving hundreds of dollars, and also generated revenue. It has all the elements, which you can find in state-of-the-art modern dashboards like light and dark theme, localization (multiple languages), and also the user can filter the data according to the time period, and generate CSV file and PDF reports from the dashboard. </p>
